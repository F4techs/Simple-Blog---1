            <p> He is a well known music director and And famous tamil rapper from Tamil Nadu <br> 
              Their commercial break-through came with the song "Club le Mabbu le" in 2011. In 2012,<br>
                 Hiphop Tamizha released their debut album Hip Hop Tamizhan, which is India's first Tamil hip hop album.<br>
                     It was a major success with both the general public and critics. While the duo were originally independent musicians, since 2013 they have contributed primarily to composing for films.<br>

                       <h2><i> Birth of Hip Hop Tamizha and Career Growth </i></h2>

                         <p> Aadhi & Jeeva started the Hip Tamizha <br>
                           Adhi and Jeeva met via Orkut in 2005. They were passionate about music and decided that they should create an independent music group in India, in Tamil.[9] According to The Hindu and Hiphop Tamizha's Facebook page, Adhi had not officially founded Hiphop Tamizha until 15 February 2010.<br>
                             Around the mid-2000s, Adhi released Viswaroobam Arambam,[1] the first Tamil hip hop mixtape in India.[b] It also played a major role in promoting hip hop as a part of the Tamil culture.[8] Adhi and Jeeva remained underground until they were asked by the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission to compose an election anthem.[17] Hiphop Tamizha's single Ezhuvoam Vaa was chosen as the official anthem for Tamil Nadu's 2011 state elections,[18] and Adhi performed it at Pachaiyappa's College when Anna Hazare came there.[17] Though the song was commercially unsuccessful,[19] Adhi and Jeeva considered it at one point their "best work so far".[20] </p>

                               <h2><i> Commercial Succcess </i></h2>

                                 <p> Adhi composed the song "Club le Mabbu le" in his first year of college.[17] When we asked how it developed, he recalled, "I grew up watching my mother and aunts just being traditional, and when I saw girls going to bars, I immediately wrote the lyrics of that track. And through my lyrics I am raising the debate over whether we are really changing as a society or are simply aping the West."[21] When Adhi was living in Chennai, he met Ma Ka Pa Anand, then an RJ at Radio Mirchi.[10] Anand allowed Adhi to perform Club le Mabbule on his radio show with beatboxer Bharadwaj Balaji (also known as Triple B).[9][22] The recording went viral, receiving over two million views within a week of its release on YouTube. Afterwards RÃ©my Martin, an international brand, was surprised by Adhi's determination and launched Hiphop Tamizha as an official brand.[9] "Club le Mabbule" later vaulted Hiphop Tamizha further into public view when it was criticised as portraying Tamil women in a negative light.[23]

                                     Hiphop Tamizha's debut album Hip Hop Tamizhan was released on 17 August 2012 at Sathyam Cinemas in Chennai. Publicised as "India's first Tamil hip hop album", it was launched by Purple Note and produced by Remy Martin, in the latter's first association with an Indian album. The music was composed by Adhi and Jeeva, with lyrics by Adhi.[18] The album was lauded by critics. Naren Weiss, writing for Zomba, called it "nothing short of a masterpiece", while Venkatrangan R of Musicperk labelled it "A must listen. Not only for the music but for the messages hidden in it."[18][non-primary source needed] The album, which included Club le Mabbule, was also a commercial success, becoming the best-selling music album of 2012 on Flipkart.[24] However, Adhi lamented the fact that "Club le Mabbule" was accepted for airplay by radio channels only after its viral success, and that some of his other songs never got airplay even once.[25]

                                         In November 2013, Adhi signed an international album with Remy Martin, titled International Tamizhan, slated to feature eight tracks, including two songs by American artists Sol and Emcee Call. The album was to be released in English, Hindi and Tamil. It was initially scheduled for release on 15 August 2014;[19][citation needed][26] however, Hiphop Tamizha instead released the album's song "Vaadi Pulla Vaadi" as a single on the same date.[27][28] In October 2014, Adhi said the album was still "under progress",[9] but confirmed in 2018 that it was altogether dropped because "independent music doesn't make big money" in Chennai.[29] In August 2020, Adhi announced a new album titled Naa Oru Alien.[30] </p>
